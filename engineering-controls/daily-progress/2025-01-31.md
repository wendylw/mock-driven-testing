**What We Built/Explored Today:**
Successfully implemented the complete Pure Component Intelligent Analysis System, integrating a sophisticated backend with real-time APIs and a responsive frontend. The system now provides real-time baseline health monitoring, deep problem diagnostics with root cause analysis, and AI-powered suggestions including visual, code, and interactive recommendations.

**Early Findings:**
- What surprised us: The AI's ability to generate contextually aware, multi-layered suggestions that adapt based on component type and usage patterns exceeded expectations
- What's harder than expected: Managing the type system complexity when bridging backend analysis models with frontend UI requirements, especially for nested suggestion structures
- What shows promise: The interactive AI assistant's ability to maintain conversation context and provide step-by-step guidance shows potential for dramatically reducing the learning curve for developers

**Key Learning:**
Today's main focus was having AI handle backend planning and implementation, finding little difference from yesterday's key learnings. When given clear architectural design and explicit implementation steps, AI can systematically complete complex backend service construction, including database design, API implementation, and service integration.

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
Implement Phase 7: Real-time updates and caching optimization. Focus on WebSocket integration for live baseline status updates, implement intelligent cache invalidation strategies, and optimize the analysis pipeline for sub-second response times.

**Open Question:**
Currently AI claims to have completed 70% of the work. Need to research how to visually verify that the intelligent suggestions it provides are reliable. Will likely require checking against real components - something to investigate further.
