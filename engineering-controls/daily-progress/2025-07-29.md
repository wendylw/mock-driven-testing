**What We Built/Explored Today:**
Enhanced the MDT platform's Pure Components baseline management system, redesigned the snapshot management interface, and optimized Button component testing scenarios based on real beep-v1-webapp project data.

**Early Findings:**
- What surprised us: Real project component usage patterns are more focused and practical than expected
- What's harder than expected: Converting mock data to real project data requires deep understanding of actual business scenarios
- What shows promise: Component type-based grouping interface design clearly demonstrates different usage scenarios

**Key Learning:**
Through continuous collaboration with AI, we discovered the core business value of the MDT platform: building an AI-driven "Component Change Intelligence Monitoring System." When developers modify component code, AI can automatically analyze code changes, real-time determine if there are breaking changes (such as API changes, visual regressions, performance degradation), and provide early warnings during the development phase. Through multi-level verification (code level, visual level, functional level, performance level), AI can completely automate testing validation work that previously required manual effort, significantly reducing testing costs and improving development efficiency.

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
Optimize core functionality and user experience of the baseline management system.

**Open Question:**
How to design an intelligent baseline update strategy that can capture meaningful changes without being frequently triggered by minor adjustments.
