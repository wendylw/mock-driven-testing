**What We Built/Explored Today:**
Explored the content structure needed for pure component baselines, completed data model design, and implemented a basic data architecture that can solve 80% of display requirements.

**Early Findings:**
- What surprised us: Today I broke away from my usual working pattern with AI, shifting from plan-making and plan-execution to a more open exploration mode. Discovered that exploratory projects require continuous brainstorming processes at every detail level
- What's harder than expected: Distinguishing different project types requires different working modes. Exploratory tasks and traditional execution tasks have fundamental differences, requiring more flexible collaboration approaches
- What shows promise: AI provides an excellent brainstorming foundation. By having AI envision future scenarios and then reverse-questioning the rationality and practicality of each design, better design ideas can emerge

**Key Learning:**
In company client-facing projects, we and AI are mostly in executor roles. But for conceptual projects like mock driven testing, which are open-ended challenges, they require designer imagination. AI becomes a catalyst for imagination. Project designers can spark better design ideas through continuous discussions with AI, breaking free from traditional project processes and engineering controls to create more valuable solutions.

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
Complete the design and implementation of the pure component intelligent suggestion feature, which I expect will be a technical challenge.

**Open Question:**
What content should branch detection results include? What kind of information is truly useful and practical for this functionality? Need to further explore real user needs.
